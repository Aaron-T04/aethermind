- Updated all branding references

## What You Should Do Next

### 1. **Fork & Rename the Repository**

```bash
# If you haven't already, fork the repo on GitHub
# Then rename it to something like:
# - aethermind
# - aethermind-workflow-builder
# - aethermind-ai
```

### 2. **Update Repository Metadata**

**On GitHub:**
- Update repository name
- Update description: "AetherMind – Autonomous AI Workflow Builder powered by Gemini and AI/ML API"
- Update topics/tags
- Add your team info to README

**In code:**
- Already done: `package.json` name is "aethermind"
- Already done: App title is "AetherMind"

### 3. **Add Your Unique Value Proposition**

What makes AetherMind different from Open Agent Builder:

**Your Differentiators:**
- ✅ **Gemini-first approach**: Built specifically for Gemini 1.5 Flash
- ✅ **Multi-agent orchestration**: Gemini for reasoning + AI/ML API for sub-agents
- ✅ **Hackathon focus**: Optimized for AI Genesis Hackathon 2025
- ✅ **Research workflows**: Specialized templates for research → analysis → summary
- ✅ **Demo-friendly**: No auth required, instant access

**Add to README:**
```markdown

Extended for AI Genesis Hackathon 2025 by Team Aether.
```

### 6. **Deploy as Your Own**

**Vercel:**
- Deploy from your forked repo
- Use your own domain (optional)
- Set environment variables

**Convex:**
- Your own Convex project
- Your own database
- Completely separate from original

**Clerk:**
- Your own Clerk app (or skip for demo)

### 7. **Make It Production-Ready (Post-Hackathon)**

If you want to continue after the hackathon:

1. **Re-enable authentication** (currently disabled for demo)
2. **Add user management** (if needed)
3. **Add billing/subscriptions** (if monetizing)
4. **Add more templates**
5. **Add workflow sharing**
6. **Add analytics**

## What Makes It "Yours"

### ✅ Already Yours:
1. **Different codebase**: You've customized it significantly
2. **Different branding**: AetherMind vs Open Agent Builder
3. **Different focus**: Gemini + AI/ML API vs general purpose
4. **Different templates**: Your custom workflows
5. **Different deployment**: Your own Vercel/Convex instances

### 🎯 Key Point:
**Open Agent Builder is a template/starting point** - like how many apps are built on Next.js templates. You've:
- Changed the branding
- Added new features (Gemini, AI/ML API)
- Created custom templates
- Modified the UI/UX
- Changed the focus/purpose

**This is YOUR project now** - it's a fork with significant customizations.

## Quick Checklist

## Positioning for Hackathon

**When presenting:**
- "We built AetherMind, a visual AI workflow builder"
- "It's powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash and AI/ML API"
- "Built for the AI Genesis Hackathon"
- "Inspired by Open Agent Builder, but customized for our use case"

**Don't say:**
- "We copied Open Agent Builder" ❌
- "This is just Open Agent Builder" ❌

**Do say:**
- "Built on Open Agent Builder" ✅
- "Forked and customized for Gemini workflows" ✅
- "AetherMind - our take on visual AI workflows" ✅

## Summary

**You've already made it yours!** The customizations you've done (branding, Gemini integration, templates, demo mode) make it a distinct project. Just:
1. Fork the repo (if you haven't)
2. Update GitHub metadata
3. Deploy under your name
4. Present it as AetherMind

The code is yours, the deployment is yours, the brand is yours. Open Agent Builder is just the foundation you built on - which is exactly what it's designed for! 🚀
